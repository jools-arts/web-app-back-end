# web-app-back-end
Back-end for hobby web application.

*If you wish to downlaod and run this application on your local machine, please see the .jar file that is located within the root of this repository.*

The purpose of this Spring Boot API back-end is to provide CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality which can then be accessed through my front-end web appliction.

I developed this project because I wanted to streamline the process of recording, documenting, and sharing dinosaur fossil discoveries between peers and colleagues alike.

It addresses the problem of having to manually record dinsaur fossil discoveries by hand, as paleontologists the world over can now upload their findings directly to the Triassic Park Web Application.

Over the course of this project, I learnt how to use new technologies such as Spring Boot which aid in the efficient development of web applications.

*At the current time of writing, this application has not been rigorously tested therefore, you may encounter some bugs/errors when attempting to run the application on your local machine.*
